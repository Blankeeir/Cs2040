// Initialize an empty list to store signs
Create an empty list called signs

// Read the number of signs
scanner read integer n

// Loop to read each sign and extract middle letters
For i from 1 to n do:

    Create a Sign object with text = signText and middleLetters = middleLetters
    Add the Sign object to the signs list

// Sort the signs based on middle letters using a stable sort
Sort the signs list based on the middleLetters attribute of each Sign object

// Print the sorted signs
For each Sign in signs do:
    Print Sign.text
